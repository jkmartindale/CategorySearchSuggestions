This is a MediaWiki extension which changes the search box behavior to include suggestions from categories and all content namespaces, showing from which namespace each suggestion is from. This is done by shamelessly stealing [Niklas Laxstr√∂m](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Nikerabbit)'s extension [MixedNamespaceSearchSuggestions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MixedNamespaceSearchSuggestions) and adding a horrible JavaScript mess that somehow gets it to work with categories as well.

Requires MediaWiki 1.25 or newer.
